Cool — here are a number of real-world public bots / repos / mini apps that more or less use the “Telegram + web-app / AI / media-generation / interactive UI” pattern. Some are close to what you want (image generation, WebApp UI, galleries), others show parts of the flow (mini-app, bot + web UI, etc.). This should give you good inspiration for your own 3D-avatar/NFT-bot idea.

## ✅ Example bots / repos / mini-apps

| Bot / Repo / Mini-App            | What It Does / Why It’s Relevant                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **telegram‑web‑app‑bot‑example** | Minimal reference/demo of a Telegram bot + WebApp — shows how a bot can open a custom HTML/JS UI inside Telegram. Serves as the clean base for embedding anything (3D viewer, UI, gallery). ([GitHub][1])     |
| **Telegram‑Web‑App‑Playground**  | A playground repo for testing Telegram Web Apps — good for experimenting with UI inside Telegram before integrating with your backend. ([GitHub][2])                                                          |
| **StableDiffusionTelegram**      | A bot that lets users generate images from text (using Stable Diffusion) via Telegram. Demonstrates media generation + Telegram UX. ([GitHub][3])                                                             |
| **segmind_telebot**              | Another Telegram bot for AI image generation (text → images). Good example of using external image-generation API and piping results back to users. ([GitHub][4])                                             |
| **DalleTelegramBot**             | A bot using the DALL·E model — users send prompts, get back images. Similar to segmind bot but with different model; shows prompt-to-media pipeline inside Telegram. ([GitHub][5])                            |
| **GeminiTelegramBot**            | A bot that claims to use Gemini 2.0 Flash for conversations + AI image generation inside Telegram. Useful to study if you want to integrate Google-stack (or similar) generation + Telegram UI. ([GitHub][6]) |

## 📚 Why these are useful as inspiration

* The “web-app + bot” repos show how you can embed a custom UI (HTML/JS) inside Telegram. That means you can embed a **3D viewer** (via `<model-viewer>` or similar) instead of a plain image — just like you imagined.
* The image-generation bots show a working pattern: user sends prompt → backend (AI model) → returns media → sends it back through Telegram. That pipeline is very similar to what you’d need for 3D-avatar/NFT generation: user choices or prompt → generate 3D asset or preview or video → deliver a link / gallery / viewer.
* You can combine both ideas: a web-app UI to collect user parameters (drop-downs, custom description) + AI/3D asset generation backend + media / 3D model preview + Telegram bot wrapper that coordinates everything.

## 🧪 What’s missing (or what you’d need to extend)

* None of the open-source bots I saw implement a **full 3D avatar generator** (glTF, model viewer, 3D + NFT metadata + gallery + persistent storage). Most focus on 2D image generation.
* To get full 3D + NFT + interactive gallery + “mint later” logic, you’d need to build on top of these — but these bots give you the essential base layer (Telegram + generation + media delivery + user prompts).
* If you go the “mini-app” route (web-app inside Telegram), you’ll need to build a frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and backend (to generate / store 3D assets, generate metadata, serve viewer pages). The “web-app + bot” repos show exactly how to structure that integration.

---

## 🎯 What I Recommend as Next Step for You

If I were you and I were building your NanoBanana 3D avatar / NFT bot now — I’d **clone one of those repos first** (like telegram-web-app-bot-example or Telegram-Web-App-Playground) and run a local prototype:

1. A Telegram bot that has a “Design Avatar” button.
2. That button opens a WebApp (static HTML/JS) inside Telegram.
3. The WebApp shows a simple dummy UI (drop-downs + “Generate”).
4. On “Generate”, the WebApp sends data back to bot → bot calls a placeholder backend that just returns a static sample (e.g. a banana image or 3D-model viewer page).
5. Bot sends back results to user (gallery, buttons).

Once that flow works — you can gradually upgrade from static samples → real 3D models, generated assets, storage, metadata, etc.

---

If you like — I can also **filter** and deliver a **short list (2–3)** of **open-source projects** that are *closest* to what you want (3D + Telegram UI + generation). That way you don’t have to dig through 6+ repos, you can start from the ones that are already conceptually most aligned. Want me to build that list for you now?

i want to see some high quality 3d avatars that are like video game quality. 

Cool — happy to show you some high-quality 3D avatars / characters (video-game-quality and near that level) to use as inspiration for yours. Below are a few examples and galleries — different styles: realistic, stylized, stylized-fantasy / sci-fi / game-ready.

---

## 🎯 Example 3D avatars / character galleries

### **Realistic / AAA-style avatars / characters**

![Image](https://game-ace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/image_005.jpg)

* You can browse a curated set of “AAA-quality 3D characters” on this studio portfolio — they do high-fidelity, stylized + realistic game-ready 3D characters. ([AAA Game Art Studio][1])
* Another good reference is a personal 3D artist’s portfolio showing real-time / game-production quality character models. ([Portfolio][2])

**Why useful for you:** These show what “top-tier 3D avatars” look like — realistic texturing, lighting, anatomy or stylized design, polish. That level of detail is what you might aim for with your 3D-avatar / NFT-character builds.

### **Stylized / Game-art / Fantasy & Sci-Fi Avatars**

* On general 3D character asset marketplaces (for game dev or indie games), there are thousands of stylized or semi-realistic avatars — good balance between low-poly, stylized, and “game-ready.” ([artstation.com][3])
* There are even free 3D characters / models (as placeholders or base models) that you could use for prototyping, before you generate or commission full custom avatars. ([KitBash3D][4])

**Why this works for you:** Since your “NanoBanana” idea leans more creative / stylized / maybe even cartoonish (with neon / laser / sci-fi vibes), this kind of avatar works very well. It’s more forgiving, easier to generate or customize, and fits an NFT/collectible/“digital character” style.

---

## 🔎 Platforms + Sources with 3D Avatars / Assets

If you want to dig deeper or start grabbing 3D models (or at least browsing for inspiration):

* **Sketchfab** — a massive community & platform for 3D models, VR/AR assets; many of their uploaded models are “game-quality” ready, and you can view them in the browser. ([Wikipedia][5])
* **AAA Game Art Studio** — they have a portfolio of “AAA-quality 3D characters for video games,” from realistic to stylized. Good to explore for professional-level avatars. ([AAA Game Art Studio][1])
* **Free-model repositories** (like from open-source 3D-asset sites or free-3D-model collections) — useful as base meshes / starting points if you want to build or iterate quickly without starting from scratch. ([KitBash3D][4])

---

## ✅ What to Learn from These Examples (and What to Aim For)

From what I saw across these galleries / portfolios:

* High-quality 3D avatars often have careful **texturing + materials** (not flat colors) — metal, cloth, skin, subtle wear & tear, realistic lighting.
* Even stylized avatars benefit from **good lighting and shading + strong silhouette / design language** — this matters especially if you plan neon / sci-fi / manga-style avatars (like your NanoBanana idea).
* Many “game-ready” avatars are **rigged and optimized for real-time rendering** — good for 3D viewer, VR/AR, or future interactive experiences.
* For NFTs / Web-based avatar viewing — something like a glTF / GLB export from a model on Sketchfab or from a 3D-art studio render will often work directly in a web-viewer.

---

## 🎯 My Thoughts: What I’d Use for Your Project

If I were you, trying to build a “NanoBanana 3D avatar / NFT / Telegram-bot” — I’d start as follows:

* Browse stylized-fantasy / sci-fi avatars on Sketchfab or from a studio portfolio — find a base model that fits your vibe.
* Use that as a base, then build on top (textures / accessories / custom traits).
* Use a WebGL viewer (like `<model-viewer>` or embed via Sketchfab or similar) to preview avatars in-browser or via Telegram Web-App.
* Once the avatar base and style feels good — convert/export to GLB / glTF so it's easy to serve, animate, and embed.

---

If you like — I can **pull up 5–10 specific 3D avatar GLB files or downloadable assets** (free or low-cost) that look *very close* to what you might want for a “stylized sci-fi / neon banana / character-collectible” — then you could test them immediately in a viewer. Want me to build that list for you now?

it needs to be all executable via an api from user prompts from telegram... can you search for avatar builder apis?


Yes — there *are* a number of APIs and services out there for avatar / 3D-avatar building (some more mature than others) that you could plug into via Telegram backend + your own orchestration. Here are good ones + what to watch out for (vs. building totally custom).

## ✅ Avatar / 3D-Avatar APIs & Services you could leverage

| Service / API                                                                                                                             | What it gives you / What it supports                                                                                                                                                                        | Notes / Fit for your use case                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Ready Player Me**                                                                                                                       | Cross-platform avatar creator + SDK/API; lets you build customizable avatars (with different outfits, styles, etc.), handle rigging/optimization, and work across engines/platforms. ([Ready Player Me][1]) | Great “plug-and-play” avatar backend — you could hook this up so Telegram users pick options, then you call ReadyPlayerMe API and return the result (avatar model, link, etc.) |
| **Avatar SDK** (from AvatarSDK.com)                                                                                                       | Allows creating 3D avatars from a selfie (or input image), with realistic or cartoon-style output. ([avatarsdk.com][2])                                                                                     | Could be used if you want “photo → avatar” automation; simpler integration path than building from scratch                                                                     |
| **Avaturn** (or related “realistic 3D avatar from selfie” services)                                                                       | Lets users upload a selfie or image and get a 3D avatar + 3D model export (FBX/GLB/other) + customization (body type, clothes, etc.). ([Avaturn][3])                                                        | Good for “realistic or semi-realistic human avatars.” If you adapt for stylized / fantasy or “banana-cyberpunk” style you may need extra processing.                           |
| **in3D**                                                                                                                                  | SDK + API/web service to create realistic full-body 3D avatars (scan via phone camera), export as 3D model (FBX, GLB, USDZ), suitable for games/metaverse. ([in3d.io][4])                                   | Useful for realistic avatars; could plug into your backend so Telegram-triggered avatar generation → model file → viewer or NFT export                                         |
| **Rendora**                                                                                                                               | AI-powered 3D avatar / video generation platform: you feed script or prompts → it returns 3D avatar videos, animations, renders. ([rendora.ai][5])                                                          | If you want to skip manual rigging/texturing and go straight to avatar video / presentation (e.g. for social media, preview, or NFT promo), this could be handy.               |
| **Some lighter/avatar-image APIs** (for fallback or placeholders) — e.g. DiceBear (but note: mostly 2D/cartoon-style) ([dicebear.com][6]) | Fast, simple HTTP API to generate avatar images based on a seed or parameters                                                                                                                               | Not ideal for 3D — but useful if you sometimes just need a quick placeholder avatar (profile pics, thumbnails) rather than full 3D/nft models                                  |

---

## ⚠️ What to check / trade-offs when using these vs full custom pipelines

* **Style & custom vibe** — Most of the off-the-shelf services produce more “normal human” avatars (realistic or semi-stylized). For your “NanoBanana / cyberpunk banana / sci-fi / creative character” vibe, you may need extra customization or custom art, or use those avatars as base + apply overlays/skins.
* **Licensing / export rights** — If you plan to mint NFTs or allow resale/trading, verify whether the service’s license allows commercial use / distribution / re-uploading of generated models.
* **Rigging / animation / export format** — Good APIs (ReadyPlayerMe, in3D, Avaturn) export to game-ready formats (FBX, GLB, etc.) and sometimes include rigs/animations — which helps if you plan to build 3D viewer + web or further animate/morph.
* **Integration complexity** — Some APIs are simple REST calls (selfie → model), others may need SDKs, authentication, customizing output, or even manual moderation if you allow custom appearance.
* **Quality vs cost / speed** — High-quality, production-ready 3D avatars tend to have higher compute/storage cost or licensing fees. Some services offer “free tier / limited output,” some are paid.

---

## 🎯 My Take — What I’d Use If I Were Building Your Telegram + 3D-Avatar / NFT Project

If I were you and wanted to get a working prototype fast:

* Use **Ready Player Me** or **in3D** to handle avatar generation + export. Good mix of quality and ease-of-integration.
* Build a Telegram bot + Web App (as we sketched before) — user picks style/options → backend calls ReadyPlayerMe or in3D → get back model URL → store metadata + model (on my own cloud or IPFS) → send user a preview or link + optionally “mint as NFT later.”
* For more stylized / sci-fi / creative (banana, neon, game character) avatars: either extend the generated model (texture/skin overlay + custom mesh) or commission a 3D artist — using the auto-generated avatar as base to build on.
* Use a pipeline that supports exporting to GLB / glTF (web friendly) so you can embed in a web viewer or present 3D in a Telegram web-app or webview.

---

If you like — I can **sketch a “decision table/flow”** for you that helps pick *which API/service* to use depending on **avatar style goal** (realistic human, stylized humanoid, sci-fi, cartoon, bananas/abstract) + **use case** (quick prototype vs long-term NFT project vs animated video vs game-ready).
