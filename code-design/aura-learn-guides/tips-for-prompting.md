HTML Generation Tips

Creating effective prompts for HTML generation can significantly improve your results. Here are some specialized tips:

1
Specify the framework or library

Mention whether you want vanilla HTML/CSS or a specific framework like Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or Material UI.

Generate a contact form using Tailwind CSS with responsive design and form validation.
2
Define the component structure

Outline the key elements you need.

Create a product card with image at the top, product title, price, short description, and an 'Add to Cart' button.
3
Include responsive behavior requirements

Specify how your design should adapt to different screen sizes.

Create a navbar that collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices under 768px width.
4
Reference a style guide or brand colors

Provide color codes or style information.

Use the color palette #3A86FF (primary), #FF006E (accent), and #FFFFFF (background) with rounded corners (8px radius).
5
Mention interactive elements

Describe any animations or effects.

Include a hover effect that scales the card by 1.05x and adds a subtle shadow when users hover over the product.
6
Provide a reference or inspiration

Point to existing designs.

Create a testimonial section similar to those on Airbnb's homepage with avatar, quote, and customer name.
Hero Section Example
Component Prompts

These templates are starting points. For best results, customize them with your specific design requirements.

Use these sample prompts as templates for common UI components:

Hero Section
Generate a modern hero section for a SaaS product with Tailwind CSS. Include a headline, subheading, CTA button, and a floating mockup image on the right side. Make it fully responsive.
Pricing Table
Create a 3-tier pricing table with Tailwind CSS. Each card should have a plan name, price, feature list with checkmarks, and a signup button. Highlight the recommended plan and make it responsive.
Navigation Bar
Design a sticky navigation bar with logo on left, navigation links in center, and login/signup buttons on right. Make it collapse to a hamburger menu on mobile, with a smooth slide-in animation.
Testimonial Cards
Create a testimonial section with 3 cards in a row. Each card should have a customer image, quote, name, and position. Use a clean design with subtle shadows and rounded corners. Add a star rating at the top of each card.
Responsive Design

Writing effective prompts for responsive designs:

Responsive Design Strategies
1
Specify breakpoints

Define exactly when layouts should change.

Create a layout that switches from 3 columns on desktop (1024px+) to 2 columns on tablet (768px to 1023px) and 1 column on mobile (below 768px).
2
Describe mobile-specific behaviors

Detail how elements should adapt.

On mobile, the navigation menu should collapse into a hamburger icon that, when clicked, reveals a full-screen overlay menu with a close button in the top-right corner.
3
Prioritize content for mobile

Explain what content is most important.

On mobile, prioritize the sign-up form by placing it above the feature list. On desktop, display them side-by-side.
4
Specify touch-friendly elements

Request appropriate sizing for touch interfaces.

Make all buttons at least 44px tall on mobile for better touch targets, with 16px spacing between interactive elements.
Device Framing

For more realistic mockups, request your UI to be framed within appropriate device containers:

Desktop Browser Frame

Frame your design in a browser window with traffic lights (close, minimize, maximize buttons).

Create a landing page and frame it within a modern browser window with macOS-style traffic light buttons (red, yellow, green) in the top-left corner.
iPhone Frame

Showcase mobile designs within an iPhone frame with notch and buttons.

Design a mobile app screen for a fitness tracker, and place it inside a modern iPhone frame with the notch/Dynamic Island at the top.
iPad Frame

Present tablet designs in an iPad frame with characteristic bezels.

Create a tablet version of our dashboard and display it within an iPad Pro frame with thin bezels and rounded corners.
Pro Tip

When requesting device frames, include details about the device's environment to make mockups more realistic. For example, specify desktop wallpaper for browser frames, or add reflections and shadows to mobile devices.

Framing Implementation Tips
1
Specify exact device models

"Frame this design in an iPhone 14 Pro" is better than "put this in a phone frame."

2
Request contextual elements

Include URL bars for browser frames or status bars with realistic time/battery indicators for mobile frames.

3
Add environmental context

"Show the iPhone on a wooden desk with soft lighting" creates more realistic mockups.

4
Consider angle and perspective

"Show the iPad at a slight angle (15°) with a subtle shadow beneath it" adds depth to presentations.

Styling & Frameworks

Tips for specifying styling and frameworks in your prompts:

Framework Selection
Be explicit about CSS frameworks

"Generate a contact form using Bootstrap 5 with form validation and floating labels" is better than just "Create a contact form."

Class Patterns
Include specific class patterns

For Tailwind users: "Use Tailwind's container class with mx-auto and px-4 for proper spacing and centering."

Component Libraries
Specify design system or component library

"Create a dashboard layout using Material UI components with a sidebar, header, and main content area."

CSS Architecture
Mention CSS architecture

"Use BEM methodology for CSS class naming and organization with separate component-based stylesheets."

Reference Known Styles
Reference your favorite apps

"Design a settings page in the style of Apple's iOS interface" or "Create a music player with Spotify's dark theme aesthetic."

Typography & Fonts

Typography plays a crucial role in UI design. Effective typography enhances readability, establishes hierarchy, and strengthens brand identity. Here's how to leverage modern fonts in your designs:

Typography Fundamentals

When requesting designs, be specific about typography preferences including font family, weight, size, line height, and letter spacing. This ensures consistent, readable, and visually appealing text across your interface.

Animation Techniques

Enhance your UI with these animation techniques that bring designs to life:

Fade-in Effects

Gradually reveal elements for a subtle, elegant entrance.

Add a simple fade-in animation to the hero section that transitions from opacity 0 to 1 over 800ms with an ease-in-out timing function.
Slide-in Animations

Move elements into position from off-screen.

Create a slide-in animation for the sidebar that enters from the left with a transform: translateX(-100%) to translateX(0) transition.
Blur Effects

Transition from blurred to clear for a dramatic reveal.

Apply a blur-in effect to images where they start with filter: blur(10px) and transition to filter: blur(0) when they enter the viewport.
Sequenced Animations

Stagger animations across multiple elements.

Create a staggered entrance for list items where each item appears 150ms after the previous one using incremental animation-delay values.
Animation Examples

Rotate
Sequence
Note: Each demo uses CSS animations with different timing functions and properties to create unique effects.
Animation Timing & Delays

Fine-tune your animations with precise timing and delay controls:

1
Duration

Set animation-duration for how long an animation takes to complete one cycle.

animation-duration: 500ms; /* Half a second */
2
Delay

Use animation-delay to postpone the start of an animation.

animation-delay: 250ms; /* Quarter second delay */
3
Timing Function

Control animation acceleration with animation-timing-function.

animation-timing-function: ease-in-out; /* Smooth start and end */
4
Negative Delays

Use negative animation-delay values to start an animation partway through its cycle.

animation-delay: -2s; /* Starts 2 seconds into the animation */
Animation Best Practices

Keep animations subtle and purposeful. Use the prefers-reduced-motion media query to respect user preferences for reduced motion. Aim for animations under 500ms for UI interactions to maintain responsiveness.

JavaScript Visualization Libraries

Leverage powerful JavaScript libraries to create impressive visual effects with minimal custom code:

Three.js

Create 3D scenes, models, and animations directly in the browser.

Create a landing page with a Three.js background featuring a slow-rotating 3D model of our product.
COBE.js

Lightweight library for creating interactive 3D globes.

Add a COBE.js globe to our 'Global Presence' section that highlights our office locations with markers.
Vanta.js

Animated backgrounds with minimal configuration.

Use Vanta.js BIRDS effect as a subtle animated background for our newsletter signup section.
GSAP

Professional-grade animation library for modern websites.

Implement a staggered fade-in animation using GSAP for the features list as users scroll down the page.
Learning Tailwind's Design System

Understanding Tailwind's design systems will help you create more effective and consistent prompts:

Color System

Tailwind uses a numeric scale for color intensity, from 50 (lightest) to 900 (darkest).

Create a button with a blue-600 background that changes to blue-700 on hover, with white text.
Spacing System

Tailwind uses a consistent spacing scale where 1 unit equals 0.25rem (4px by default).

Add p-4 for padding, mt-6 for margin-top, and gap-2 between flex items.
Typography Scale

Tailwind's font sizes range from text-xs to text-9xl, with standardized line heights.

Use text-xl font-medium for headings and text-sm text-gray-600 for descriptions.
Responsive Design Patterns

Learn Tailwind's breakpoint prefixes: sm, md, lg, xl, and 2xl.

Create a grid with grid-cols-1 on mobile, md:grid-cols-2 on tablets, and lg:grid-cols-3 on desktop.
Vanta JS Example
