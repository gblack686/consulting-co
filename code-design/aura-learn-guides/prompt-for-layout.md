Prompt for Layout

Learn how to craft effective prompts for layouts and get better results with Aura's AI-powered design tools.

Well-structured layout prompts are essential for creating professional, responsive designs that work across all devices. This guide helps you create effective layout instructions for optimal results.

Responsive Design

Creating effective prompts for responsive layouts that work well across all devices:

Responsive Design Fundamentals
1
Mobile-first approach

Always design for mobile first, then expand to larger screens.

Create a mobile-first layout that starts as a single column on phones (under 640px) and expands to a two-column grid on tablets and desktops.
2
Specify breakpoints

Define exactly when layouts should change based on common device sizes.

Create a hero section with text and image that switches from stacked (mobile) to side-by-side at 768px, with appropriate spacing adjustments at each breakpoint.
3
Content priority

Specify which content is most important and how it should be prioritized on smaller screens.

Design a product page where the purchase button is more prominent on mobile, appearing right after the product title and before the detailed description.
4
Navigation transformation

Describe how navigation should transform across different devices.

Create a navigation system that's a full-width horizontal menu on desktop (1024px+), a condensed horizontal menu on tablet (768px-1023px), and a hamburger menu with slide-out drawer on mobile (below 768px).
Important Considerations

When requesting responsive layouts, be explicit about how elements should adapt. Don't just say "make it responsive" - specify exactly how the layout should change at different screen sizes.

Common Responsive Patterns
Column Drop
Smaller screens

Multi-column layout stacks vertically as screen width decreases.

Create a three-column layout that becomes a single column on mobile, stacking the sections in order of importance.
Layout Shifter
Smaller screens

Elements reposition, not just stack, as screen size changes.

Design a product showcase where the gallery is on the left on desktop, but moves above the product information on mobile for better visual flow.
Off Canvas
Smaller screens

Secondary content is placed off-screen and shown when needed.

Create a mobile layout with a hamburger menu that reveals a slide-out navigation drawer from the left side when clicked.
Mostly Fluid
Smaller screens

Grid-based layout that reflows and eventually stacks on smaller screens.

Create a fluid grid layout with 4 items per row on large screens, 2 per row on tablets, and 1 per row on mobile.

List Layouts

List layouts are among the most common and versatile UI patterns. They're excellent for displaying collections of similar items in a clean, scannable format.

Basic List Layout
→
→
Create a list of user profiles with circular avatar images on the left, name and role information in the middle, and a chevron icon button on the right for navigation.
Contact/User Lists
JD
Create a contacts list with user avatars, names, job titles, and action buttons (call, message) aligned to the right. Use subtle hover effects for interactivity.
Settings Lists
Design a settings menu with left-aligned icons, setting names, and toggle switches on the right. Include clear section dividers and subtle background indicators for the active setting.
Notification Lists
5m
Create a notification feed with color-coded categories (red for alerts, blue for information, green for success), notification content, and relative timestamps. Include an unread indicator and dismiss button.
Product Lists
+
Design a product list for an e-commerce app with product images, names, prices, brief descriptions, and add-to-cart buttons. Include stock indicators and rating stars.
List Layout Best Practices
• Maintain consistent spacing between list items
• Use clear visual hierarchies to distinguish primary and secondary information
• Consider adding dividers or alternating background colors for long lists
• Ensure touch targets are at least 44px tall on mobile
• Include clear feedback states (active, hover, focus)
Grid Layouts

Grid layouts organize content in a structured, modular format that creates visual harmony and makes scanning information easier. Here's how to effectively prompt for different grid layouts:

Advanced Grid Layout
Create a responsive grid dashboard layout with various card sizes. The main metrics card should span 3 columns and 2 rows, with smaller cards for secondary metrics. Use grid-template-areas for complex content organization.
Card Grids
Design a product grid with 4 cards per row on desktop, 2 per row on tablets, and 1 per row on mobile. Each card should have a product image, name, price, and an add-to-cart button that appears on hover.
Masonry Grid
Create a masonry-style image gallery where images maintain their aspect ratios but align to a grid. Include lazy loading for images and a lightbox effect when clicked.
Feature Grid
Design a features grid with 3 columns on desktop and 1 column on mobile. Each feature should have an icon at the top, a heading, and a brief description. Use a consistent icon style and color scheme.
Dashboard Grid
Create a metrics dashboard with a mix of card sizes: small cards for key metrics in the top row (spanning 1 column each) and larger charts below (spanning 2-3 columns). Include card headers with titles and optional dropdown menus.
Effective Grid Layout Prompts

When requesting grid layouts, specify these important details:

• Number of columns at different breakpoints (e.g., 4 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet)
• Gap sizes between grid items (e.g., 16px horizontally, 24px vertically)
• Whether items should have equal heights or maintain aspect ratios
• Any specific items that should span multiple columns or rows
• Minimum/maximum sizes for grid items (especially important for responsive designs)

Bento Layouts

Bento layouts (named after Japanese lunch boxes) feature a grid of content blocks with varying sizes and proportions, creating visual interest while maintaining structure. They're particularly effective for dashboards, portfolios, and content-rich home pages.

Bento Grid
Design a bento grid layout for a portfolio homepage with a featured project (2x2 grid space) on the left, and two smaller project cards (1x1 each) stacked on the right. Each card should include a project image, title, and brief description.
Dashboard Bento
Create a metrics dashboard with a bento layout: small KPI cards in the top row (1x1 each), a large chart in the middle (2x2), bar charts on the bottom left (2x1), and a scrollable activity feed on the bottom right (2x1).
Content Showcase Bento
Design a content showcase with a featured article (2x2) with cover image and overlay text, a sidebar (1x3) with newsletter signup, and two smaller article cards (1x1 each) below the main feature.
Product Features Bento
Create a product features showcase with a banner section across the top (4x1) that includes a headline, brief description, and illustration. Below, add four feature cards (1x1 each) with icons, titles, and short descriptions.
Media Gallery Bento
Design a media gallery with a main large image (3x2), a wide image on the top right (3x1), and two smaller images below (2x1 and 1x1). Include hover effects that display image titles and photographers.
Bento Layout Design Principles
• Create a clear visual hierarchy with larger cells for more important content
• Maintain spacing consistency between all cells
• Use a grid system (4x4, 3x3, etc.) as the foundation
• Keep the overall layout balanced, even with differently sized elements
• Consider how the layout will collapse to a single column on mobile
• Use subtle differences in styling to group related information
Common UI Components

Key UI components are essential building blocks for any interface. Learning how to effectively prompt for these common elements will help you create cohesive and functional layouts.

Modal Dialogs
×
Create a modal dialog component with a header, close button, content area, and action buttons (Cancel/Confirm). Include a semi-transparent overlay background and subtle entrance animation. Make it responsive for mobile with full-width display on small screens.
Action Bars
Design an action bar with left-aligned tool buttons (with tooltips on hover) and right-aligned primary/secondary action buttons. Make it stick to the top or bottom of the viewport as needed. For mobile, collapse less important actions into a menu button.
Top Navigation Bars
Create a top navigation bar with logo on the left, horizontal navigation links in center, and user profile/settings on the right. On mobile, collapse links into a hamburger menu while keeping the logo and profile visible. Add a subtle shadow and make it fixed at the top of the viewport.
Sidebars
Main Content
Design a collapsible sidebar with logo/brand at top, navigation menu in the middle, and user settings at bottom. Include highlight states for active items and subtle hover effects. Make it responsive with slide-in behavior on mobile.
Inspector Panels
Main Content
Create an inspector panel for editing properties, with collapsible sections, form controls (inputs, dropdowns, color pickers), and a search filter at the top. Include a toggle to expand/collapse the panel and make it responsive.
Footers
Design a comprehensive footer with company information on the left, navigation links in the middle columns, and newsletter signup/social media icons on the right. Include a copyright notice and legal links at the bottom. Make it stack into a single column on mobile with appropriate spacing.
Component Design Best Practices
• Maintain consistent spacing and sizing across all components
• Consider accessibility needs with proper contrast and keyboard navigation
• Design for touch targets on mobile (minimum 44px height)
• Create clear visual feedback states (hover, focus, active, disabled)
• Follow platform conventions when appropriate (iOS vs Android patterns)
• Use subtle animations and transitions to improve usability
Device Framing

Device framing places your designs within realistic device mockups, which is essential for presentations, documentation, and marketing materials. Here's how to craft effective prompts for different device frames:

Desktop Browser Frame

Frame your design in a browser window with traffic lights (close, minimize, maximize buttons).

Create a landing page and frame it within a modern browser window with macOS-style traffic light buttons (red, yellow, green) in the top-left corner, URL bar, and subtle shadow.
iPhone Frame

Showcase mobile designs within an iPhone frame with notch or Dynamic Island.

Design a mobile app screen for a fitness tracker, and place it inside a modern iPhone 15 Pro frame with the Dynamic Island at the top and status bar showing full battery and good signal.
iPad Frame

Present tablet designs in an iPad frame with characteristic bezels.

Create a tablet version of our dashboard and display it within an iPad Pro frame with thin bezels, rounded corners, and landscape orientation. Add subtle environmental shadows.
Laptop Frame

Show desktop designs in a laptop mockup to emphasize web context.

Place the website design inside a MacBook Pro frame with the screen at a slight angle as if viewed from above. Add a wooden desk texture beneath the laptop.
Desktop Monitor

Frame desktop applications or websites in a realistic monitor.

Create a desktop application UI and display it on a sleek monitor with thin bezels. Add power button and logo at the bottom, with a subtle stand.
Watch Frame

Display wearable app interfaces within a smartwatch frame.

Design a fitness app screen for a smartwatch and place it within an Apple Watch frame with the digital crown and side button visible.
Device Framing Tips
1
Specify exact device models

"Frame this design in an iPhone 15 Pro" is better than "put this in a phone frame."

2
Request contextual elements

Include URL bars for browser frames or status bars with realistic time/battery indicators for mobile frames.

3
Add environmental context

"Show the iPhone on a wooden desk with soft lighting" creates more realistic mockups.

4
Consider angle and perspective

"Show the iPad at a slight angle (15°) with a subtle shadow beneath it" adds depth to presentations.

Device Framing Prompt Template

Use this template structure for effective device framing prompts:

Create a [DESIGN TYPE] and place it inside a [SPECIFIC DEVICE MODEL] frame. Add [CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS] like status bar and [ENVIRONMENTAL DETAILS] such as [SURFACE/BACKGROUND]. Position the device at a [ANGLE/PERSPECTIVE] with [LIGHTING EFFECTS].

Create a responsive layout for a website with a mobile-first approach. Include Navigation menu, Hero section.

The layout should stack elements vertically on mobile screens (below 640px) and expand to a multi-column layout on larger screens. Include a hero section at the top with a headline on the left and image on the right (stacking vertically on mobile).

Ensure all spacing and typography scales appropriately across different device sizes with appropriate breakpoints at 640px, 768px, and 1024px.
Customization Tip

For even better results, you can further customize the generated prompt with specific details about your project, such as color schemes, typography preferences, or particular UI elements you need.

Practical Examples

Ready-to-use layout prompts for common UI patterns. Copy these examples and customize them for your specific needs:

Landing Page Layout
Create a modern landing page layout with the following sections: 1. A hero section at the top with a headline on the left and a feature image on the right. On mobile, the image should stack below the headline. 2. A 3-column features section with icons, headings, and brief descriptions that becomes a single column on mobile. 3. A testimonial section with a client quote and photo. 4. A call-to-action section with centered text and a prominent signup button. Use Tailwind CSS with a subtle shadow on cards, rounded corners (8px radius), and comfortable padding (24px) between sections. Include proper spacing adjustments for tablet (768px) and mobile (below 640px) breakpoints.
Dashboard Layout
Design a dashboard layout with: 1. A fixed sidebar (240px wide) on the left with logo at top, navigation links in the middle, and user profile at bottom. On mobile, this transforms into a collapsible drawer. 2. A top navigation bar with search input, notifications icon, and settings dropdown. 3. Main content area with: - A grid of 4 small metric cards (1x1) in the top row - A large chart (2x1) below - A data table below that 4. Ensure adequate spacing between components (16px) and proper padding within cards (16px). Use a clean design with subtle borders (#F0F0F0), light gray backgrounds (#F9F9F9) for cards, and a white (#FFFFFF) main background. Make it responsive with appropriate stacking on tablet and mobile views.
E-commerce Product Page

XL
Create an e-commerce product page layout with: 1. A product image gallery on the left (60% width on desktop) with a large main image and thumbnails below 2. Product details on the right (40% width) including: - Product name (24px, bold) - Price and rating - Short description - Color/size selection options - Add to cart button (prominent, full-width) - Shipping information 3. A tabbed section below for Description, Specifications, and Reviews 4. Related products grid at the bottom (4 items per row on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile) On mobile devices, the layout should stack with the gallery at the top, followed by product details and other sections. Ensure adequate spacing and clear visual hierarchy for scanning product information quickly.
Mobile App Screen in Device Frame
10:30
Design a mobile app screen for a fitness tracking app and place it within an iPhone 15 Pro frame. The screen should include: 1. A status bar at the top showing full battery, good signal strength, and current time (10:30 AM) 2. A dashboard with today's activity progress (steps, calories, distance) in card format 3. A circular progress indicator in the center showing daily goal completion 4. Activity history below in a scrollable list with small charts for each day 5. Bottom navigation with icons for Dashboard, Workouts, Nutrition, and Profile The iPhone frame should be shown at a slight angle (10°) with a subtle drop shadow. Place it on a gradient background and add a soft reflection beneath the device for a polished presentation.
Personal Portfolio Bento Layout
Create a personal portfolio homepage with a bento box layout with the following elements: 1. A featured project spanning 2x2 grid cells in the top-left with a project image, overlay title, and brief description 2. An about me section (1x1) with a circular profile photo and short bio 3. Skills/tools section (1x2) showing expertise areas with small icons and labels 4. Three smaller project cards (1x1 each) with hover effects that reveal project details 5. A contact/social media card (1x1) with icon links Use consistent spacing (16px gap) between all elements and maintain rounded corners (12px) throughout. The layout should collapse to a single column on mobile devices with appropriate stacking order: featured project first, about me second, then other elements. Include subtle animations for hover states and transitions.
